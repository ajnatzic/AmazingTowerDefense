TODO:
    -Add checking to placeTower to make sure its not on the path.
    -start a JUnit test (To david: pull chess project and look at how it worked there)
    -test all range functions to ensure they output the right values
    -add sound on events
        -placing towers,enemy getting to end of path, round end, ambient noises
    -add music (lots of royalty free music around)
    -decide on style of game (pixel art or not, medieval, steampunk, futuristic, traditional chinese art, etc.)
    -update javadoc and comments, run the code analyzing tools again and update the code, then merge with master when no
        bugs are found
    -Projectile is unfinished, will be finished soon, has to do and thoughts at the top to do so
    -add visualization of tower range, as a circle or shaded circle?, either
        -on hover-over of tower, or
        -always, or
        -when a button to show ranges is pushed (I like this one, but might be distracting to player)

KNOWN BUGS:  There are more, just haven't documented them
-You are able to start rounds whenever you want, even if the previous round hasn't concluded
-If you click place tower then place magic tower, the flag for magic tower doesn't get reset
