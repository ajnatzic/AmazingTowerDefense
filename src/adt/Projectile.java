/*Thoughts so far
 *
 * Need to make the enemy targeted wait to take damage until projectile gets there
 * Need to check to make sure that the projectile doesn't appear past the enemy
 *          -Check if it passed the enemy, or check the distance its traveling vs the distance to the enemy
 * spawnFrame might not be needed based on this implementation (updating the position should take care of the issue of knowing
 *      how far the projectile is
 * need to add a projectile graphic, add something in the panel to draw projectiles, and draw them facing the right way
 *      (assuming something like an arrow or bullet, circular or pixels won't need this)
 *
