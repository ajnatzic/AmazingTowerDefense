TODO:
    -make other panel for buttons, and this panel for the actual game like bloons
    -Make isPlaceTower flag able to be set to false without placing a tower
    -Add checking to placeTower to make sure its not on the path.
    -Draw up a general form for how rounds go in terms of number and pace of enemies, and implement that.
    -Start round spawns enemies based on round number
    -start a JUnit test (To david: pull chess project and look at how it worked there)
    -test all range functions to ensure they output the right values
    -add sound on events
        -placing towers, starting round, enemy getting to end of path, round end, enemy death, ambient noises
    -add music (lots of royalty free music around)
    -decide on style of game (pixel art or not, medieval, steampunk, futuristic, traditional chinese art, etc.)
    -update javadoc and comments, run the code analyzing tools again and update the code, then merge with master when no
        bugs are found
    -Projectile is unfinished, will be finished soon, has to do and thoughts at the top to do so
    -add visualization of tower range, as a circle or shaded circle?, either
        -on hover-over of tower, or
        -always, or
        -when a button to show ranges is pushed (I like this one, but might be distracting to player)

KNOWN BUGS:  There are more, just haven't documented them
    -Bruiser health doesn't go down when it should
    -Rounds don't end when all the enemies are sent and killed


MISC. COMMENTS:
    David: We need testing soon and badly, I have no diea
